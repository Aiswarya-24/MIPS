# MIPS
A 32-bit pipelined MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages) implementation has been developed using Verilog HDL, focusing on a key feature of pipelined architecture to enhance performance. This implementation supports a simplified version of the MIPS instruction set architecture, enabling it to handle basic arithmetic and logical operations, as well as memory loads and stores, along with branch instructions. 

The application scope of this MIPS processor design is geared towards general-purpose computing operations within System-on-Chip (SoC) designs. By utilizing the Xilinx Vivado tool, the development process was streamlined, ensuring efficient design, simulation, and synthesis of this 32-bit MIPS processor with a pipelined structure. This implementation serves as a foundational component for SoC designs, providing a flexible and efficient solution for various computing tasks within embedded systems and similar applications.
